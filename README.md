# World-University-Rankings

Finding methods to rank Universities in the World is a process that is highly challenging and often is accompanied by controversy and varying opinions. There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. This dataset contains three global university rankings from very different places. The rankings include Times Higher Education World University Ranking, Academic Ranking of World Universities, and The Center for Word University Rankings. The CWUR (Center for World University Rankings) data samplings do not come from surveys and university data submissions. Instead, the rankings rely more on outcome-based samplings.
